# Vite + React Project Readme

## Project Overview

This project is a web application built using Vite and React. Vite is a fast build tool that aims to provide a lightning-fast development experience for web projects. React, on the other hand, is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

- Node.js: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
- npm: [https://www.npmjs.com/](https://www.npmjs.com/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
cd your-project
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Development

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will launch the application at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) by default.

## Build

To build the production-ready bundle, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate a `dist` folder containing optimized and minified assets.

## Deployment

You can deploy the contents of the `dist` folder to your preferred hosting service.
